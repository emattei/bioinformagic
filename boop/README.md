This is my collection of [Boop](https://github.com/zoeyfyi/Boop-GTK) scripts.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

## Setup

To use custom scripts, you need to tell Boop where to find them. Open the preferences Menu ( Boop > Preferences... or âŒ˜, ) and go to the Scripts tab. You'll be able to set a custom path for Boop to look in.

## List of Available Scripts

- [Reverse Complement](./docs/ReverseComplement.md): Reverse complement a DNA sequence.
- [To Array](./docs/ToArray.md): Convert lines of text into a Python or R array. Use `/<tool>` as first line to set the format.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue if you have ideas for new scripts or improvements.
